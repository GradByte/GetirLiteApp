## Features

- [x] Product Listing
- [x] Product Detail
- [x] Shopping Cart

## Requirements

- iOS 15.2+
- Xcode 13.2+

## How to run?

Running this application is a straightforward process, requiring no special configurations. However, in case you encounter any issues during execution, ensure that you are utilizing the recommended versions of the package dependencies listed below:

- Alamofire: 5.9.1
- Kingfisher: 7.11.0

## Technical Details

- iOS Version and Framework: The app is built for iOS 15.2 and above using UIKit framework.
- Architecture: VIPER (View, Interactor, Presenter, Entity, Router) architecture pattern is employed for organizing the codebase. This promotes separation of concerns and facilitates unit testing.
- UI Layout: Compositional Layout is utilized for arranging UI elements, providing flexibility and efficiency in managing complex layouts.
- Data Management:
    - Singleton Class: A singleton class named "LocalData" is implemented for storing selected products and total bill locally. This ensures a single instance of the class throughout the app's lifecycle.
    - Core Data Integration: Core Data is employed for saving and loading selected products and total bill state, ensuring persistence even when the app is closed or reopened.
- Networking: Alamofire is used as the networking manager to handle API requests and responses efficiently. This abstracts away the complexities of network handling and provides a cleaner interface for API interactions.
- Custom Cells:
    - Product Cell: A custom cell used in both the listing and shopping cart screens to display product information.
    - Selected Product Cell: Another custom cell exclusively used in the shopping cart screen to display selected products.
- Protocol Implementation:
    - ProductProtocol: Implemented to transform MainProduct and SuggestedProduct objects into a unified Product format. This abstraction allows for easier management and display of product data in the collection view cells.
- Functionality:
    - Persistence: The use of Core Data ensures that selected products and total bill are preserved across app sessions, preventing data loss.
    - Lifecycle Management: The app utilizes lifecycle events such as closing and opening to trigger Core Data operations for saving and loading data, maintaining continuity in user experience.
